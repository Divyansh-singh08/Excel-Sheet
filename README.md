# Excel Clone Project

This project is an Excel clone built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation. It aims to replicate essential Excel functionalities while providing a hands-on learning experience in web development and algorithms.

## Features

- Task Management: Organize tasks efficiently within the Excel-like grid.

- Code Formatting: Format code snippets conveniently within the cells.

- Graph Algorithm for Formula Evaluation: Utilizes a graph algorithm for accurate formula evaluation.

- Color Animation: Visualize data changes with color animations for better user experience.

- Two-way Binding: Implement two-way binding to track cell changes dynamically.

- Copy, Cut, and Paste: Incorporates standard Excel functionalities for ease of use.

- File Download and Upload: Allows users to download and upload Excel files, enhancing user-friendliness and data portability.


## Purpose
The Excel clone project serves as a learning platform to strengthen concepts in:

- DOM manipulation
- HTML/CSS styling
- JavaScript programming
- Algorithm implementation, specifically graph algorithms

## Challenges
During the development process, challenges were encountered, such as:

Implementing complex graph algorithms for formula evaluation.
Designing the user interface creatively to mimic Excel's grid layout effectively.

## Tech Stack

**HTML/CSS:** Structuring and styling the user interface.

**JavaScript:** Core programming language for functionality implementation.

**DOM Manipulation:** Interacting with the document object model for dynamic updates.

**Graph Algorithm:** Used for precise formula evaluation and cell dependency tracking.
